- traditional poll() is very portable and is a reasonable choice for use of
  weighttp on a local network with high percentage of active descriptors
  (ready events) each poll().  However, for a huge number of concurrent
  connections (e.g. thousands), a more advanced event framework (such as
  bpoll, libuv, libev, libevent) might be more performant.
  (bpoll is part of https://github.com/gstrauss/bsock)

- Using tcmalloc did not appear to measurably improve performance.  YMMV.
    export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libtcmalloc.so.4
  This is expected since memory allocations in the rewritten weighttp all occur
  at startup, and the majority are done per-thread for exclusive use by each
  thread.
